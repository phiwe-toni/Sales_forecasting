Business Forecasting and Demand Prediction
Predicting Restaurant Item Demand Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

This project focuses on forecasting demand for restaurant items by analyzing historical sales data, exploring patterns, and comparing multiple predictive modeling techniques including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

The goal is to build a robust forecasting system that helps restaurants anticipate future demand, optimize inventory planning, and reduce waste.
